# Productivity apps wrapper

This project aims to be a wrapper for some common productivity apps that I use in my everyday basis. This project is the result of me
wanting to find a way for looking at all my productivity data, and having to do it on my own due to the poor integrations made
by [zapier.com](http://zapier.com/) and [automate.io](http://automate.io/).

It aims to help you do understand what you get done every day, keep track of it, get valuable statistics out of your daily performance, and
performing even better on your next day.

### Apps wrapped

- [Todoist](http://todoist.com/) for tasks management
    - Habits project independently
    - Goals project independently
- [RescueTime](http://rescuetime.com/) for passive time tracking
- [Wakatime](http://wakatime.com/) (IDE's plugin for programming time tracking)


- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) as the place where the data of the previous 3 resides.

### Tools used

- [Todoist API](https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v8/)
- [RescueTime API](https://www.rescuetime.com/apidoc) (Special thanks to the [@rescue_time]() team, who helped me with API fixes for this)
- [WakaTime API](https://wakatime.com/developers)
- Notion new Beta [official API](https://developers.notion.com/)
- Notion [Unofficial python API](https://github.com/jamalex/notion-py) (without this I also could've not achieved this project)
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) for deploying the app as is the simplest and quickest I found

## Setting up your own instance ðŸš€

### Todoist setup

- Projects named ```Goals``` and one named ```Habits``` are required for the Habits and Goals pages respectively, everything else is
  dynamic.
